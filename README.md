# esp32-iot-base

ESP32-WROOM-32E based IoT development board for [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) designed with [KiCad EDA](https://www.kicad.org/)

## Project Status

This board is still in it's early design phase...

- [x] Design basic PCB layout
- [x] Generate fabrication data
- [ ] Fabicate and test prototypes

The intention was to use the ESP32-C3 SOC but arduino and esphome support for this generation of chips currently in an early stage and therfore the ESP32-WROOM-32E is used in the meantime.
